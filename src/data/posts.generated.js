    "content": "# AI Assisted System Design Interview Prep\n\nDesign interviews reward clarity more than cleverness. Over the last year I've been pairing a handful of AI tools with a small ritual so I can stay present in the conversation instead of juggling checklists.\n\n## A 5-minute ritual\n\n1. **Frame the goal.** Restate the ask in business language and confirm constraints.\n2. **Pick a reference.** Choose a familiar system that rhymes with the prompt.\n3. **Map the people.** Who uses it, who supports it, who observes it.\n4. **Trace the data.** Identify the critical read/write paths and the failure budget.\n5. **Name the risks.** Surface two trade-offs early, then refine as you go.\n\n## Using AI without losing your taste\n\n- Let the model critique: _“Where would this design fail?”_\n- Summarize aloud: use the AI summary as the seed, then edit until it sounds like you.\n- Keep a scrap pad: short prompts like `\"alternatives to Kafka for fan-out under 1M QPS?\"` speed up exploration.\n\n## What to practice\n\n- Draw fast boxes and arrows; redraw them slowly with labels.\n- Speak in timelines: cold start, steady state, failure, recovery.\n- Close with **what you would measure first**—it signals ownership beyond the interview."

To reopen the exits:\n\n- Rotate hard problems; do not let the same people hold the pager forever.\n- Make experimentation cheap—**two-week spikes** with a premortem and a demo.\n- Publish \"what we will not do\" every quarter to avoid polite zombie projects."

    "content": "# How To Be Great 101\n\nGreatness is rarely a leap—it is a rhythm. The most consistent high performers I know do three things differently: they **choose a pace they can keep**, **protect their curiosity**, and **ship small proofs weekly**.\n\n### Choose a pace you can keep\n\nSprints are fine, but long careers are marathons. Calibrate workload with two questions:\n\n- What would make this effort sustainable for 12 months?\n- What tiny proof can I deliver in 7 days?\n\n### Protect your curiosity\n\n- Schedule a 90-minute window each week for unstructured tinkering.\n- Keep a one-line log of interesting problems you heard about; revisit monthly.\n\n### Ship small proofs weekly\n\nA \"proof\" might be a one-pager, a prototype, or a narrated Loom. Small proofs lower the stakes, surface feedback, and build trust."

You create clarity faster than others create ambiguity.\n2. You design reviews that teammates look forward to.\n3. You leave behind paved paths—docs, starter kits, and defaults that persist."
