# How To Be Great 101

Greatness is rarely a leap—it is a rhythm. The most consistent high performers I know do three things differently: they **choose a pace they can keep**, **protect their curiosity**, and **ship small proofs weekly**.

### Choose a pace you can keep

Sprints are fine, but long careers are marathons. Calibrate workload with two questions:

- What would make this effort sustainable for 12 months?
- What tiny proof can I deliver in 7 days?

### Protect your curiosity

- Schedule a 90-minute window each week for unstructured tinkering.
- Keep a one-line log of interesting problems you heard about; revisit monthly.

### Ship small proofs weekly

A "proof" might be a one-pager, a prototype, or a narrated Loom. Small proofs lower the stakes, surface feedback, and build trust.
