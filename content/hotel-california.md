# Hotel California

Teams can get stuck in pleasant stagnation: stable metrics, low churn, sleepy ambition. To reopen the exits:

- Rotate hard problems; do not let the same people hold the pager forever.
- Make experimentation cheap—**two-week spikes** with a premortem and a demo.
- Publish "what we will not do" every quarter to avoid polite zombie projects.
