# Becoming a Staff Engineer

Staff is less about volume of code and more about **shaping work**. Three signals I look for:

1. You create clarity faster than others create ambiguity.
2. You design reviews that teammates look forward to.
3. You leave behind paved paths—docs, starter kits, and defaults that persist.
